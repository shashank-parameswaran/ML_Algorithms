# Algorithm_KNN_Classifier

K Nearest Neighbours method uses the closest k observations to predict the output. We are using Euclidean distance as a measure of closeness. After finding the k closest observations we take the average of each class of response and assign the predicted output with the highest average.

Train and test datasets contain 200 observations each. Test dataset does not contain the 'Y' label so you wont be able to check the accuracy. The purpose of this exercise is to try and code the KNN algorithm from scratch. There are two dependant variables we are using here and it has been named as X1 and X2.
